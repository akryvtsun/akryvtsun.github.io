My name is Andriy (Ukrainian: *Андрій*) but people often call me Andy (sometimes even Andrzej or Andre).

I wrote my first program in BASIC computer language in my school notebook with a regular pen in the late 80s 
as I didn't have access to a computer at that time. My first personal computing device was a Soviet programmable microcalculator 
[Elektronika MK-61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektronika_MK-61) and I recall with great pleasure weeks spent 
writing and launching programs on it (actually those programs were something between binary codes and Assembly language).

Currently I’m a senior software engineer with over two decades of professional experience in the IT industry.

I’m definitely a backend guy. My actual technical stack consists of JVM-based computer languages (mostly Java, but also 
Kotlin and Scala too) and related technologies (like Spring framework, Hibernate, JUnit etc.) but in beginning of my career 
there was a period when I worked as a system network administrator and even passed Oracle Database Administration exam.

I have experience working in product and service companies both in my home country Ukraine as well as abroad. 
I lived in the New York City area for over four years working onsite in a bank. Since then I have fallen in love with 
[street photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_photography) and hate the office dress code.

My professional interests lie in the field of software architectures, Domain Driven Design (DDD), functional programming 
and creation of distributed systems.

I'm a Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform (SCJP) and Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP).
